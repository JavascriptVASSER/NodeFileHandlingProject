This Node.js project is a simple demonstration of file handling. It allows you to read data from a text file and write data to another text file using the Node.js fs (File System) module. The project is structured as follows:

fileOperationsHandler.js: The main script for the project. It imports functions from the fileOperations.js file and demonstrates how to read and write files.

fileOperations.js: This file contains functions for file operations. It provides functions for reading data from a file and writing data to a file. The functions return promises to handle asynchronous file operations.

The project aims to help you understand how to work with files in Node.js, showcasing basic file reading and writing operations. It's a foundation for more advanced projects that involve file manipulation and data storage.
